Stock Price Tracker using React State
--------------------------------------

creating a Stock Price Tracker using React.js to demonstrate the usefulness of State in React.

For a web application that dynamically updates its content, in this case at a high frequency! 

React.js can be useful to do that work with less code and high efficiency.

React State re-renders the page every time its value is updated and uses a Virtual DOM, 

which can be updated efficiently by updating only changes in the actual DOM.


**API**
------------------------------------------------

We will be using the IEX Cloud API to request for latest stock prices.

To use their API, you can get an API token from their website.
